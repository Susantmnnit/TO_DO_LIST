1. How long did you spend on the coding test?
   Ans : 12 h

2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

Ans: {tasks.length === 0 ? (
<p>No tasks to show</p>
) : (
tasks.map(task => (
// Task display code...
))
)}

3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
   Ans: To track down performance issues in production, I use monitoring the codes, along with browser developer tools like Chrome's Performance tab to identify bottlenecks in rendering and network requests. Optimizing backend queries, caching, and improving frontend performance (e.g., lazy loading, code splitting) are key steps to resolve these issues.

4. If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application?

Ans: I would like to dd features like
a. Due date reminder.
b. Task category.
c. Toggle dark and light mode.
d. Add server for better data consistancy.
e. Assign task to other users.
